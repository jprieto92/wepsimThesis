It is concluded that distributed computing and collaborative environments that support the interaction of multiple computers, as well as the interaction of computers with humans, are the paradigms that will characterize gigabit applications.<>},

    abstract = {{The Globus Toolkit (GT) has been developed since the late 1990s to support the development of service-oriented distributed computing applications and infrastructures. Core GT components address, within a common framework, basic issues relating to security, resource access, resource management, data movement, resource discovery, and so forth. These components enable a broader  Globus ecosystem  of tools and components that build on, or interoperate with, core GT functionality to provide a wide range of useful application-level functions. These tools have in turn been used to develop a wide range of both  Grid  infrastructures and distributed applications. I summarize here the principal characteristics of the latest release, the Web services-based GT4, which provides significant improvements over previous releases in terms of robustness, performance, usability, documentation, standards compliance, and functionality.}},

Identification and tracking technologies, wired and wireless sensor and actuator networks, enhanced communication protocols (shared with the Next Generation Internet), and distributed intelligence for smart objects are just the most relevant. As one can easily imagine, any serious contribution to the advance of the Internet of Things must necessarily be the result of synergetic activities conducted in different fields of knowledge, such as telecommunications, informatics, electronics and social science. In such a complex scenario, this survey is directed to those who want to approach this complex discipline and contribute to its development. Different visions of this Internet of Things paradigm are reported and enabling technologies reviewed. What emerges is that still major issues shall be faced by the research community. The most relevant among them are addressed in details."

abstract = "Abstract Ubiquitous sensing enabled by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies cuts across many areas of modern day living. This offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban environments. The proliferation of these devices in a communicating–actuating network creates the Internet of Things (IoT), wherein sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fueled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling wireless technologies such as \{RFID\} tags and embedded sensor and actuator nodes, the IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is the next revolutionary technology in transforming the Internet into a fully integrated Future Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need for data-on-demand using sophisticated intuitive queries increases significantly. This paper presents a Cloud centric vision for worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT research in the near future are discussed. A Cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public Clouds is presented. We conclude our IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of WSN, the Internet and distributed computing directed at technological research community."

abstract={National and international projects such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, Europe's particlephysics laboratory near Geneva in Switzerland, or the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope planned for northern Chile, are frequently cited for the way they will challenge the state of the art in computation, networking and data storage. In a sense, landmark international projects like the LHC are the least problematic: the costs of data management are explicit in the budget and tend to be dominated by technology expenses that decline over time. ...] in the United States, for example, there are also other focused archives connected to some disciplines, including the collections at the NIH's National Center for Biotechnology Information, the social science archive of the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research based at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, and the Protein Data Bank, which holds structural data for proteins and nucleic acids.},

abstract = "Abstract Previous distributed file systems aim at storing very large data sets. Their architectures are often designed to support large-scale data-intensive applications, which cannot cope with massive daily users who want to store their data on the Internet. In this paper, \{CSTORE\} is proposed to support mass data storage for a large number of users. The user-independent metadata management can ensure data security through assigning an independent namespace to every user. Operating logs are applied to synchronize simultaneous sessions of the same user and resolve conflicts. We also implement a block-level deduplication strategy based on our three-level mapping hash method for the large quantity of repeated data. The migration and rank extension on the hash rules are defined to achieve load balancing and capacity expansion. Performance measurements under a variety of workloads show that \{CSTORE\} offers the better scalability and performance than other public cloud storage systems."

abstractNote={GlusterFS is a Linux based distributed file system, designed to be highly scalable and serve many clients. Some reasons to use GlusterFS are: No centralized metadata server, Scalability, Open Source, Dynamic and live service modifications, Can be used over Infiniband or Ethernet, Can be tuned for speed and/or resilience and Flexible administration. It’s useful for enterprise environments - virtualization; high performance computing (HPC) and it works with Mac, Linux and Windows clients. Conclusions are: (1) GlusterFS proved to have widespread capabilities as a virtual file system; (2) Scalability is very dependent upon the underlying hardware; (3) Lack of built-in encryption and security paradigm; and (4) Best suited in a general purpose computing environment.},

We seek to develop a model of TCP communication which is both high-level and realistic. Previous research works show that accurate and global modeling of wide-area networks, such as the Internet, faces a number of challenging issues. However, some global models of fairness and bandwidth-s- haring exist, and can be link with the behavior of TCP. Using both previous results and simulation (with NS), we attempt to understand the macroscopic behavior of TCP communications. We then propose a global model of the network for the Grid platform. We perform partial validation of this model in simulation. The model leads to an algorithm for computing bandwidth-sharing. This algorithm can then be implemented as part of Grid application simulations. We provide such an implementation for the simulation toolkit.}},

    abstract = {{Researchers in the area of distributed computing conduct many of their experiments in simulation. While packet-level simulation is often used to study network protocols, it can be too costly to simulate network communications for large-scale systems and applications. The alternative is to simulate the network based on less costly flow-level models. Surprisingly, in the literature, validation of these flow-level models is at best a mere verification for a few simple cases. Consequently, although distributed computing simulators are widely used, their ability to produce scientifically meaningful results is in doubt. In this work we focus on the validation of state-of-the-art flow-level network models of TCP communication, via comparison to packet-level simulation. While it is straightforward to show cases in which previously proposed models lead to good results, instead we systematically seek cases that lead to invalid results. Careful analysis of these cases reveal fundamental flaws and also suggest improvements. One contribution of this work is that these improvements lead to a new model that, while far from being perfect, improves upon all previously proposed models. A more important contribution, perhaps, is provided by the pitfalls and unexpected behaviors encountered in this work, leading to a number of enlightening lessons. In particular, this work shows that model validation cannot be achieved solely by exhibiting (possibly many) ''good cases.'' Confidence in the quality of a model can only be strengthened through an invalidation approach that attempts o prove the model wrong.}},

abstract ={This article describes an implementation of MPI-IO using a new parallel file system,                called Expand (Expandable Parallel File System), which is based on NFS servers.                Expand combines multiple NFS servers to create a distributed partition where files                are striped. Expand requires no changes to the NFS server and uses RPC operations to                provide parallel access to the same file. Expand is also independent of the clients,                because all operations are implemented using RPC and NFS protocols. Using this                system, we can join heterogeneous servers (Linux, Solaris, Windows 2000, etc.) to                provide a parallel and distributed partition. The article describes the design,                implementation and evaluation of Expand with MPI-IO. This evaluation has been made                in Linux clusters and compares Expand and PVFS.},

abstract = "Precision agriculture is a field which provides one of the most suitable scenarios for the deployment of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The particular characteristics of agricultural environments – which may vary significantly with location – make \{WSNs\} a key technology able to provide accurate knowledge to farmers. This knowledge represents a valuable resource because it enables real-time decision making with regard to issues such as establishing water saving policies while providing adequate irrigation and choosing the right time to harvest the fruit based on its maturity. This article proposes a methodology consisting of a set of well-defined phases that cover the complete life cycle of \{WSN\} applications for agricultural monitoring. We have studied different existing real-world scenarios where \{WSNs\} are being applied. Based on this study we have discovered that there exist significant commonalities but no methodology that specifies the best practices that should be used in the general, crop-independent case. The lack of a general methodology negatively impacts the amount of effort, development time, and cost of developing applications. "

abstract = "Nowadays, high performance computing is being improved thanks to different platforms like clusters, grids, and volunteer computing environments. Volunteer computing is a type of distributed computing paradigm in which a large number of computers, volunteered by members of the general public, provide computing and storage resources for the execution of scientific projects. Currently, volunteer computing is used for high throughput computing, but it is not used for parallel applications based on \{MPI\} due to the difficulty in communicating among computing peers. As Sarmenta and Hirano (1999) [2] said, there are several research issues to be solved in volunteer computing platforms, one of them is ‘implementing other types of applications’. In fact, the \{BOINC\} team (the well known volunteer computing development platform) is requesting ‘MPI-like support’ for volunteer computing as one of its hot topics. This paper proposes an extension of the usual capabilities of volunteer computing and desktop grid systems by allowing the execution of parallel applications, based on MPI, on these types of platforms. The goal of this paper is to describe a method to transform and adapt \{MPI\} applications in order to allow the execution of this type of applications on volunteer computing platforms and desktop grids. The proposed approach does not require an \{MPI\} installation on the client’s side, which keeps the software to be installed on the client quite lightweight. The paper describes the prototype built, and also shows the evaluation made of this prototype, in order to test the viability of the idea proposed in this article, with promising results. "

abstract = "Abstract Cloud-based storage is a popular outsourcing solution for organizations to deliver contents to end-users. However, there is a need for contingency plans to ensure service provision when the provider either suffers outages or is going out of business. This paper presents SkyCDS: a resilient content delivery service based on a publish/subscribe overlay over diversified cloud storage. SkyCDS splits the content delivery into metadata and content storage flow layers. The metadata flow layer is based on publish–subscribe patterns for insourcing the metadata control back to content owner. The storage layer is based on dispersal information over multiple cloud locations with which organizations outsource content storage in a controlled manner. In SkyCDS, the content dispersion is performed on the publisher side and the content retrieving process on the end-user side (the subscriber), which reduces the load on the organization side only to metadata management. SkyCDS also lowers the overhead of the content dispersion and retrieving processes by taking advantage of multi-core technology. A new allocation strategy based on cloud storage diversification and failure masking mechanisms minimize side effects of temporary, permanent cloud-based service outages and vendor lock-in. We developed a SkyCDS prototype that was evaluated by using synthetic workloads and a study case with real traces. Publish/subscribe queuing patterns were evaluated by using a simulation tool based on characterized metrics taken from experimental evaluation. The evaluation revealed the feasibility of SkyCDS in terms of performance, reliability and storage space profitability. It also shows a novel way to compare the storage/delivery options through risk assessment. "

Many multiprocessor file systems provide applications with a conventional Unix-like interface, allowing the application to access multiple disks transparently. This interface conceals the parallelism within the file system, increasing the ease of programmability, but making it difficult or impossible for sophisticated programmers and libraries to use knowledge about their I/O needs to exploit that parallelism. In addition to providing an insufficient interface, most current multiprocessor file systems are optimized for a different workload than they are being asked to support. We introduce Galley, a new parallel file system that is intended to efficiently support realistic scientific multiprocessor workloads. We discuss Galley's file structure and application interface, as well as the performance advantages offered by that interface."

  abstract={We report on the completion of the first version of a new-generation simulation code, FLASH. The FLASH code solves the fully compressible, reactive hydrodynamic equations and allows for the use of adaptive mesh refinement. It also contains state-of-the-art modules for the equations of state and thermonuclear reaction networks. The FLASH code was developed to study the problems of nuclear flashes on the surfaces of neutron stars and white dwarfs, as well as in the interior of white dwarfs. We expect, however, that the FLASH code will be useful for solving a wide variety of other problems. This first version of the code has been subjected to a large variety of test cases and is currently being used for production simulations of X-ray bursts, Rayleigh-Taylor and Richtmyer-Meshkov instabilities, and thermonuclear flame fronts. The FLASH code is portable and already runs on a wide variety of massively parallel machines, including some of the largest machines now extant.}
